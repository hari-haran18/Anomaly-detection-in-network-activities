# Anomaly-detection-in-network-activities

This project concerns the field of Cyber Security
and aims at detecting DOS or DDOS attacks.
Although we had developed the project with the
Institute Gateway in our mind, the software works
pretty well with any other network or any personal
computer. The main aim of our team was to build a
software from scratch that is light, gives the user
real time information about the said network and
could work independently. The project presented
below is developed with the sole motive of detecting
a DOS attack by distinguishing it from legitimate
network traffic efficiently. However, we aim at
improving our software with the help of various
deep learning techniques while keeping our
software light and fast.
